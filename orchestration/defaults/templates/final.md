## Your Task - Ship Decision
This is the final review round. Provide a clear SHIP or NO-SHIP recommendation.

## Decision Criteria
Consider:
1. Are all critical issues resolved?
2. Are high priority issues addressed or have workarounds?
3. Does the code meet minimum quality standards?
4. Are there any ship-blocking concerns?

## Required Output
1. **Decision**: SHIP / NO-SHIP
2. **Reasoning**: Brief justification (2-3 sentences)
3. **Conditions** (if SHIP with conditions): List any requirements
4. **Blocking Issues** (if NO-SHIP): List items that must be fixed

Be decisive. This determines if the code is ready for production.
