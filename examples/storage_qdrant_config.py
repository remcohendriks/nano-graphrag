Example: Using Qdrant Vector Storage with GraphRAGConfig

This example demonstrates how to use Qdrant as the vector storage backend
with the new GraphRAGConfig configuration system.

Requirements:
- qdrant-client: pip install qdrant-client
- Running Qdrant instance: docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

Environment variables (optional):
- QDRANT_URL: URL of Qdrant instance (default: http://localhost:6333)
- QDRANT_API_KEY: API key for Qdrant Cloud (optional)
