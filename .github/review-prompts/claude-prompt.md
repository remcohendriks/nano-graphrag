# Code Review Instructions

You are reviewing a pull request for the nano-graphrag project. This is a Python GraphRAG implementation focused on simplicity and hackability.

## Review Focus Areas

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks, exposed secrets)
- Logic errors that would cause runtime failures
- Missing error handling for critical paths
- API contract violations
- Data corruption risks

### High Priority Issues
- Performance bottlenecks (O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms)
- Resource leaks (unclosed files, connections, etc.)
- Race conditions or concurrency issues
- Missing type hints for public APIs
- Test coverage gaps for critical functionality

### Medium Priority Issues
- Code duplication that could be refactored
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing documentation for complex logic
- Non-idiomatic Python patterns
- Configuration management issues

### Low Priority Suggestions
- Style inconsistencies
- Minor optimization opportunities
- Additional test cases for edge cases
- Documentation improvements
- Code organization suggestions

## Review Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Include file paths and line numbers when referencing code
2. **Be Constructive**: Suggest concrete improvements, not just problems
3. **Be Pragmatic**: Focus on issues that matter for code quality and maintainability
4. **Consider Context**: Review changes in the context of the existing codebase
5. **Check Tests**: Verify test coverage for new functionality

## Project-Specific Considerations

- **Async Patterns**: Verify proper async/await usage and error handling
- **Provider Abstraction**: Check that LLM/embedding providers follow the base interface
- **Storage Patterns**: Ensure storage implementations are consistent
- **Test Patterns**: Tests should use mocks to avoid network dependencies
- **Type Safety**: All public APIs should have proper type hints
- **Configuration**: Changes should maintain backward compatibility
