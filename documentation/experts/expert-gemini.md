# Code Review Request

## Your Task
Conduct a thorough review of the codebase below. As the Requirements reviewer, focus on your areas of expertise while noting any other concerns.

## Code Analysis Steps

### Initial Assessment
1. Get commit comparison: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-status`
2. Generate change statistics: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --stat`
3. Read commit message: `git log -1 --format="%B"`
4. Identify change category: [New Feature|Bug Fix|Refactor|Config Change|Integration]

### File-by-File Analysis
For each file in step 1:

5. View the diff: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [filename]`
6. Read complete CURRENT file: `cat [filename]`
7. Read complete PREVIOUS file: `git show HEAD~1:[filename]`
8. List all functions/classes changed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [filename] | grep -E "^[+-](def |class )"`
9. Identify imports added/removed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [filename] | grep -E "^[+-](import |from )"`

### Context Mapping
10. Find all files importing changed modules: `grep -r "from $(dirname [filename]).$(basename [filename] .py) import" --include="*.py"`
11. Find all files this module imports: `grep -E "^(import |from )" [filename]`
12. Locate related test files: `find . -path "*/test*" -name "*$(basename [filename] .py)*" -o -name "*test_$(basename [filename] .py)"`
13. Check if tests were updated: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- $(find . -path "*/test*" -name "*$(basename [filename] .py)*")`

### Document Findings
14. For each issue found, record:
    - **Finding ID**: [EXPERT_PREFIX]-[NUMBER]
    - **Location**: [filename]:[line_numbers]
    - **Severity**: Critical|High|Medium|Low
    - **Evidence**: [exact code snippet or diff]
    - **Impact**: [what breaks/degrades if not fixed]
    - **Recommendation**: [specific fix]

15. List positive observations using same structure (prefix: [EXPERT_PREFIX]-GOOD-[NUMBER])

## Requirements-Specific Analysis

### Requirements Traceability
16. Extract requirements from commit/PR:
    - List acceptance criteria mentioned
    - Identify user stories referenced
    - Note any "should/must/shall" statements

17. Map implementation to requirements:
    - For each requirement, find implementing code
    - Note any requirements without corresponding changes
    - Identify changes without corresponding requirements

### Test Coverage Analysis
18. Analyze test modifications:
    - New test cases added: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*test*.py" | grep -E "^[+][ ]*def test_"`
    - Test cases removed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*test*.py" | grep -E "^[-][ ]*def test_"`
    - Test assertions changed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*test*.py" | grep -E "^[+-].*assert"`

19. Check edge case handling:
    - Null/None checks: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(if .* is None|if not .*:)"`
    - Exception handling: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(try:|except|raise)"`
    - Boundary conditions: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(< 0|> max|<= 0|>= len)"`

### Documentation Validation
20. Check documentation updates:
    - Docstring changes: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -B2 -A10 '"""'`
    - README updates: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "README*" "*/README*"`
    - API docs: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*.md" "docs/*"`

21. Validate user-facing changes:
    - Error messages: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(raise|ValueError|Exception).*\("`
    - Log statements: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(log\.|logger\.|logging\.)"`
    - Config changes: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*.yml" "*.yaml" "*.json" "*.toml" "*.ini"`

## Quick Commands Reference
- Changed files: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-status`
- View diff: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [file]`
- Current file: `cat [file]`
- Previous file: `git show HEAD~1:[file]`
- Find usages: `grep -r "[term]" --include="*.py"`
- Find tests: `find . -name "*test*[module]*"`
- Check imports: `grep -E "^(import |from )" [file]`

## Finding Format
[EXPERT]-[###]: [file]:[line] | [Severity] | [Issue] | [Fix]

## Review Instructions
Provide a comprehensive review covering:
1. Critical issues (must fix before deployment)
2. High priority issues (should fix soon)
3. Medium priority suggestions (improvements)
4. Low priority notes (nice to have)
5. Positive observations (well-done aspects)

Be specific with:
- File names and line numbers
- Clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Concrete fix recommendations
- Code examples where helpful

## Output Format
Structure your review with clear sections and priorities.
Start with an Abstract section summarizing you review like an academic paper.
Use markdown formatting for readability.
