# Code Review Request

## Your Task
Conduct a thorough review of the codebase below. As the Debug reviewer, focus on your areas of expertise while noting any other concerns.

## Code Analysis Steps

### Initial Assessment
1. Get commit comparison: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-status`
2. Generate change statistics: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --stat`
3. Read commit message: `git log -1 --format="%B"`
4. Identify change category: [New Feature|Bug Fix|Refactor|Config Change|Integration]

### File-by-File Analysis
For each file in step 1:

5. View the diff: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [filename]`
6. Read complete CURRENT file: `cat [filename]`
7. Read complete PREVIOUS file: `git show HEAD~1:[filename]`
8. List all functions/classes changed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [filename] | grep -E "^[+-](def |class )"`
9. Identify imports added/removed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [filename] | grep -E "^[+-](import |from )"`

### Context Mapping
10. Find all files importing changed modules: `grep -r "from $(dirname [filename]).$(basename [filename] .py) import" --include="*.py"`
11. Find all files this module imports: `grep -E "^(import |from )" [filename]`
12. Locate related test files: `find . -path "*/test*" -name "*$(basename [filename] .py)*" -o -name "*test_$(basename [filename] .py)"`
13. Check if tests were updated: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- $(find . -path "*/test*" -name "*$(basename [filename] .py)*")`

### Document Findings
14. For each issue found, record:
    - **Finding ID**: [EXPERT_PREFIX]-[NUMBER]
    - **Location**: [filename]:[line_numbers]
    - **Severity**: Critical|High|Medium|Low
    - **Evidence**: [exact code snippet or diff]
    - **Impact**: [what breaks/degrades if not fixed]
    - **Recommendation**: [specific fix]

15. List positive observations using same structure (prefix: [EXPERT_PREFIX]-GOOD-[NUMBER])

## Pattern-Specific Analysis

### Configuration Integration
16. Verify config flow:
    - Config definition: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*config*.py" | grep -E "^[+].*class.*Config"`
    - Config usage: `grep -r "[ConfigClassName]" --include="*.py" | head -20`
    - Environment variables: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(os.environ|os.getenv)"`

17. Check config propagation:
    - to_dict() implementation: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -B5 -A10 "def to_dict"`
    - from_dict/from_env: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -B5 -A10 "def from_(dict|env)"`
    - Config validation: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(validate|check|verify)"`

### Factory Pattern Validation
18. Analyze factory changes:
    - Registration: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(register|ALLOWED_)"`
    - Lazy loading: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*def _lazy_|importlib"`
    - Creation methods: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*def create_"`

### Implementation Patterns
19. Check deterministic behavior:
    - ID generation: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(hash\(|uuid|random\.)"`
    - Use of xxhash/md5: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(xxhash|hashlib|md5)"`
    - Timestamp usage: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(time\.|datetime\.now)"`

20. Verify batching/performance:
    - Batch operations: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(batch|chunk|bulk)"`
    - Loop optimizations: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*for .* in .*[:][^:]" | wc -l`
    - Embedding calls: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(embed|embedding_batch_num)"`

21. Dependency management:
    - Optional imports: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "^[+].*(ensure_dependency|check_optional)"`
    - Import guards: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -B2 -A2 "ImportError"`
    - Package requirements: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- "*requirements*.txt" "pyproject.toml" "setup.py"`

## Quick Commands Reference
- Changed files: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-status`
- View diff: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- [file]`
- Current file: `cat [file]`
- Previous file: `git show HEAD~1:[file]`
- Find usages: `grep -r "[term]" --include="*.py"`
- Find tests: `find . -name "*test*[module]*"`
- Check imports: `grep -E "^(import |from )" [file]`

## Finding Format
[EXPERT]-[###]: [file]:[line] | [Severity] | [Issue] | [Fix]

## Review Instructions
Provide a comprehensive review covering:
1. Critical issues (must fix before deployment)
2. High priority issues (should fix soon)
3. Medium priority suggestions (improvements)
4. Low priority notes (nice to have)
5. Positive observations (well-done aspects)

Be specific with:
- File names and line numbers
- Clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Concrete fix recommendations
- Code examples where helpful

## Output Format
Structure your review with clear sections and priorities.
Use markdown formatting for readability.
