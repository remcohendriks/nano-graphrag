## Your Task
Conduct a thorough review of the codebase below. As the Architecture reviewer, focus on your areas of expertise while noting any other concerns.

## Review Instructions
Analyzing the change:
1. The developer commits on a feature branch, use `git diff` to compare the current state of the code against `main`.
2. Thoroughly analyze each file touched by the developer. You will need to read each file in full and thoroughly assess how the file was changed.
3. Ensure full understanding of the project. Analyze other files, imports, dependencies where needed to understand what happens.
4. Carefully interpret and use the ticket specification to assess if the code change adheres to the ticket's definition.
5. Ensure you have a a deep, holistic view of the project and code change, and can provide a nuanced opinion on the work.

Provide a comprehensive review covering:
1. Critical issues (must fix before deployment)
2. High priority issues (should fix soon)
3. Medium priority suggestions (improvements)
4. Low priority notes (nice to have)
5. Positive observations (well-done aspects)

Be specific with:
- File names and line numbers
- Clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Concrete fix recommendations
- Code examples where helpful

## Output Format
Structure your review with clear sections and priorities.
Start with an Abstract section summarizing you review like an academic paper.
Use markdown formatting for readability.
