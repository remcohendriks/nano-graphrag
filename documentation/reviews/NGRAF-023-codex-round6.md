# Review: NGRAF-023 Round 6 (Codex)

## Critical
- None. I re-ran the round-five repro steps and the checksum now validates cleanly. The backup code saves the manifest without its checksum before hashing, and the restore path mirrors that logic, so payload integrity checks finally pass.

## High
- None.

## Medium
- None.

## Low
- None. The only thing you might consider later is surfacing the checksum mismatch as a hard failure instead of a warning, but that’s discretionary and outside this ticket’s scope.

## Positive
- `nano_graphrag/backup/manager.py:87` – Symmetric use of `model_dump(exclude={"checksum"})` during backup and restore resolves the timing bug without extra archive passes.
- `tests/backup/test_manager.py:215` – The new regression test exercises the exact failure mode from round five; it will catch any future drift in the checksum workflow.
