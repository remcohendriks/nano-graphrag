# NGRAF-022 – Round 3 Review (Debug/Security)

## Summary
The batch Cypher now simply applies the pre-merged payload (`SET n += node.data`, `SET r += edge.edge_data`), eliminating the duplication bug. Added tests cover both syntax and data-drift regressions. No further defects observed.

## Findings
_None._

## Positive Notes
- `_execute_batch_nodes`/`_execute_batch_edges` now mirror the legacy merge semantics, fixing CDX-002/003.
- New tests (`tests/test_neo4j_no_duplication.py`, `tests/test_neo4j_cypher_syntax.py`) protect against future regressions.

## Recommendation
Looks good. Before shipping, consider running a higher-volume ingest (≫1 document) in staging to confirm no hidden performance/locking issues, but code-wise this round is solid.
