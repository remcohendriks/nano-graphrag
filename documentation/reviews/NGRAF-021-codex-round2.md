# NGRAF-021 â€“ Round 2 Review (Debug/Security)

## Summary
The template formatting guard was added and corresponding tests ensure fallback behaviour. No further defects observed.

## Findings
_No new issues identified._

## Positive Notes
- Formatting now wrapped with `try/except KeyError`, logging and reverting to the default prompt as expected.
- Regression tests cover the extra-placeholder case and confirm the warning path.

## Recommendation
Approve the change.
