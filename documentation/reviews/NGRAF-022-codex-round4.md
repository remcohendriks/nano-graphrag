# NGRAF-022 – Round 4 Review (Debug/Security)

## Summary
Deadlocks stopped occurring because documents now serialize, but we took a throughput hit. Community prompt budgets respect the model context, but we still have no higher-volume validation beyond the 1-doc health check.

## Findings
_None._

## Positive Notes
- Document ingest now runs sequentially (`graphrag.py:444-447`), eliminating cross-document Neo4j contention.
- Community prompt re-budgeting avoids the previous token overflow.
- Added regression tests for batch Cypher safety and duplication guard the new code path.

## Recommendation
Ship it, but before calling the story done run a larger ingest in staging that mimics the production load (100–200 docs). That will confirm the sequential processing change holds up and help quantify the throughput penalty.
