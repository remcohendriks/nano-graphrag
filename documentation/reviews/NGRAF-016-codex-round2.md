# NGRAF-016: Redis KV Backend — Round 2 Review (Codex)

## Summary

Round 2 addresses several Round 1 blockers:
- Configuration now propagates Redis settings from `GraphRAGConfig.to_dict()` to storage — fixed.
- Test hygiene improved using `patch.dict(sys.modules, …)` — partially fixed.
- Factory/config tests updated to recognize `redis` backend — fixed.
- TTL inputs validated and clamped to non‑negative — fixed.

The core async Redis backend remains robust for single‑node deployments with pooling, retry, pipelining, and namespace TTLs. However, the full test suite still fails due to residual mocking issues that leak across tests at import time. Once test isolation is corrected, this is close to approval for the defined scope (single‑node, async‑only).

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

CODEX-R2-001: Test suite still fails in full run due to import‑time mocking
- Location: `tests/storage/test_redis_kv_contract.py`, `tests/test_rag.py`, and `nano_graphrag/_storage/kv_redis.py`
- Evidence: Running the full suite (`pytest -q`) yields: 1 failed, 8 errors. Representative traces:
  - `TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression` from `redis.asyncio.connection.Connection.connect_check_health` (real redis code trying to await a MagicMock retry object).
  - `TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed` when code executes `except RedisError as e:` but `RedisError` was bound to a MagicMock during an earlier test’s import.
- Root cause: Tests patch `sys.modules['redis.*']` to MagicMocks, then import `kv_redis`. Those imported symbols (e.g., `RedisError`, `Retry`) are bound inside `kv_redis` and persist after the context exits. Later tests reuse the already‑imported module and hit invalid types.
- Impact: Full suite is not reliable; CI will remain red; masking of real failure modes.
- Recommendation (choose one of the safe patterns):
  - Patch internal symbols directly instead of `sys.modules`:
    ```python
    with patch('nano_graphrag._storage.kv_redis.aioredis', mock_aioredis), \
         patch('nano_graphrag._storage.kv_redis.Retry', DummyRetry), \
         patch('nano_graphrag._storage.kv_redis.ExponentialBackoff', DummyBackoff), \
         patch('nano_graphrag._storage.kv_redis.RedisError', Exception), \
         patch('nano_graphrag._storage.kv_redis.RedisConnectionError', ConnectionError):
        ...
    ```
  - If keeping `patch.dict(sys.modules, …)`, ensure `redis.exceptions` contains real Exception subclasses, not MagicMocks:
    ```python
    class _RedisError(Exception):
        pass
    class _ConnError(_RedisError):
        pass
    exceptions_stub = SimpleNamespace(RedisError=_RedisError, ConnectionError=_ConnError)
    with patch.dict(sys.modules, {'redis.exceptions': exceptions_stub, ...}):
        ...
    ```
  - As an alternative, reload `kv_redis` after setting mocks (and unload it after) to avoid cross‑test leakage:
    ```python
    import importlib, nano_graphrag._storage.kv_redis as kv_redis
    kv_redis = importlib.reload(kv_redis)
    ```
  - Do not pass MagicMock `retry` into real redis internals; if real `redis.asyncio` is in use, provide a real‑like stub whose `call_with_retry` is `async def` or remove `retry` parameter in tests.

## High Priority

CODEX-R2-002: Round 2 test report claims “All tests passing” but full run still fails
- Location: `documentation/reports/NGRAF-016-round2-implementation.md`
- Evidence: Local full run shows 1 failed, 8 errors (see above). Isolated tests pass; failures occur only in combined run due to import‑order interactions.
- Impact: Mismatch between reported and observed status can hide regressions.
- Recommendation: Fix mocking per CODEX-R2-001; re‑run full suite; update the report with actual results.

CODEX-R2-003: Type hint mismatch with base interface
- Location: `nano_graphrag/_storage/kv_redis.py::get_by_ids`
- Evidence: Signature uses `fields: Optional[List[str]]`, while the base interface in `BaseKVStorage` expects `fields: Union[set[str], None]`.
- Impact: Minor type confusion; works at runtime but misleading for users/IDE tooling.
- Recommendation: Align signature and accept both `set[str]` and `list[str]` (type hint `Optional[set[str]]` and coerce if list is provided).

CODEX-R2-004: Explicit shutdown API missing
- Location: `nano_graphrag/_storage/kv_redis.py`
- Evidence: Best‑effort cleanup in `__del__` schedules async tasks; no explicit `close()` method. Connection pool has `disconnect()`; client uses `aclose()`.
- Impact: In long‑running processes or during orderly shutdown, relying on destructors is brittle.
- Recommendation: Add `async def close(self)` that calls `await self._redis_client.aclose()` and `await self._connection_pool.disconnect()`. Call from app shutdown hooks and storage callbacks as appropriate.

## Medium Priority

CODEX-R2-005: `get_stats` remains expensive for large keyspaces
- Location: `kv_redis.py::get_stats`
- Evidence: Iterates via `SCAN` and samples `MEMORY USAGE` for first N keys.
- Impact: Acceptable for ad‑hoc diagnostics; unsuitable for frequent polling.
- Recommendation: Document cost; consider optional counters per namespace or expose a “light” stats mode.

CODEX-R2-006: JSON‑only serialization trade‑offs
- Location: `kv_redis.py::_serialize/_deserialize`
- Evidence: JSON with `default=str` only; errors logged on decode failure and return `None`.
- Impact: Non‑JSON types silently drop; acceptable for current namespaces but can surprise future extensions.
- Recommendation: Consider an opt‑in pickle fallback for non‑cache namespaces, or raise on serialize/deserialize failure for critical namespaces.

## Positive Observations

- Config propagation fixed: Redis settings included in `to_dict()` when `kv_backend == 'redis'` — correct and minimal.
- TTL validation added: Negative TTLs clamped with warnings — prevents runtime `SETEX` errors.
- Factory + config tests updated: Assertions now include `redis` — aligns test expectations with code.
- Test intent improved: Moved away from global permanent sys.modules edits to context‑managed patches — reduces cross‑test contamination risk.
- Core storage remains clean: Lazy init, pooling, retry (exponential backoff), pipelined batch ops, and namespace scoping.

## Verification

- Diff reviewed for `config.py`: Redis fields added to `to_dict()` (lines ~360–365) — confirmed.
- Diff reviewed for `kv_redis.py`: TTL validation added in `_setup_ttl_config()` — confirmed.
- Tests modified in Round 2 to use `patch.dict` and to update factory/config expectations — confirmed.
- Full suite run locally: isolated Redis tests pass; combined run surfaces residual mocking issues — reproducible.

## Verdict

Technically solid and close to production‑ready for single‑node, async Redis. Approve contingent on fixing the remaining test isolation issues (CODEX‑R2‑001/002). Cluster and sync support remain out of scope for this ticket; ensure the ticket/ACs are updated accordingly to avoid future ambiguity.
