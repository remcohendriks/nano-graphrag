# Review: NGRAF-023 Round 2 (Codex)

## Critical

### CODEX-005: nano_graphrag/backup/manager.py:76 | Critical
**Issue**: The manifest written into each archive still carries an empty checksum. The code saves `checksum=""` before archiving, later computes the real hash, but never persists it back into `manifest.json` nor packages the `.checksum` file inside the archive. Operators downloading the `.ngbak` bundle receive a manifest whose `checksum` field is blank.
**Impact**: Ticket acceptance required the manifest to expose the archive checksum. With the current bundle there is no way to validate integrity once the archive leaves the server. Disaster-recovery procedures that rely on checksum validation will fail, and downstream tooling expecting the checksum field will consider the manifest malformed.
**Reproduction**:
1. Create a backup via `POST /api/v1/backup` (or through the CLI helper).
2. Download the resulting `.ngbak` archive and extract `manifest.json`.
3. Observe `"checksum": ""` inside the manifest.
**Recommendation**: Persist the computed checksum inside the archive. Either rewrite `manifest.json` with the real value before archiving, or append an updated manifest (and the checksum file) into the tarball after computing the hash. Ensure the `.ngbak` bundle alone contains the data needed for integrity checks and add a regression test that inspects an extracted manifest.

### CODEX-006: nano_graphrag/api/static/js/backups.js:3 | Critical
**Issue**: The new `Backups` module is declared with `const Backups = { ... }` but never attached to `window`. `dashboard.js` checks `window.Backups` before invoking `init`, so the Backups tab never wires up its event handlers. The inline `onclick="Backups.*"` handlers also fail because the global property is undefined.
**Impact**: Every control on the Backups UI silently breaksâ€”"Create Backup" and "Restore Backup" do nothing, and clicking the action buttons throws `ReferenceError: Backups is not defined`. That regresses the round-one finding (missing UI) and leaves operators without any usable dashboard flow.
**Reproduction**:
1. Load the dashboard, open the Backups tab, and click "Create Backup".
2. Note that no request is made; `window.Backups` logs as `undefined` in the console.
3. Click "Download" on any row (after manually populating data) to see the reference error.
**Recommendation**: Export the module exactly like the other dashboard helpers, e.g. append `window.Backups = Backups;` (and optionally switch the inline handlers to reference `window.Backups`). Add a lightweight browser test or jest/jsdom check ensuring the module registers itself.

## Positives

### CODEX-GOOD-002: nano_graphrag/backup/exporters/qdrant_exporter.py:78
Switching restore to the official `recover_snapshot` API removes the `NotImplementedError` path from round one and aligns with the async client. Nice cleanup and better parity with production Qdrant behaviour.
