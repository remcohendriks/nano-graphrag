# NGRAF-020-2: Entity Embedding Preservation - Round 3 Implementation Report

## Executive Summary
Fixed critical entity ID generation bug in fallback path and config propagation issue that were causing duplicate entities with missing sparse embeddings. These fixes address the root cause of entities appearing without `ent-` prefix and lacking sparse vectors.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Entity ID Generation in Fallback Path [FIXED]

**Problem Identified:**
- Fallback path used raw `node_id` as key instead of `compute_mdhash_id(entity_name, prefix='ent-')`
- Created duplicate entities: `PRESIDENTIAL 1776 AWARD` instead of `ent-617c2f922232a018...`
- These duplicates had no sparse embeddings (hybrid disabled in fallback)

**Fix Applied (`graphrag.py:516-534`):**
```python
# Before (line 532):
entity_dict[node_id] = {
    "content": description,
    ...
}

# After (lines 516, 533-534):
from nano_graphrag._utils import compute_mdhash_id
...
entity_name = node_data.get("name", node_id)
entity_key = compute_mdhash_id(entity_name, prefix='ent-')
entity_dict[entity_key] = {
    "content": description,
    "entity_name": entity_name,
    ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Ensures consistent entity IDs across initial insertion and post-community updates
- Prevents creation of duplicate entities with raw names as IDs
- Maintains single source of truth for each entity

### 2. Hybrid Config Propagation [FIXED]

**Problem Identified:**
- Storage instances read hybrid config from environment only
- `to_legacy_dict()` didn't include `hybrid_search` configuration
- Even with GraphRAGConfig.hybrid_search.enabled=True, storage might not see it

**Fix Applied (`config.py:500`):**
```python
# Added to to_legacy_dict():
'hybrid_search': self.storage.hybrid_search,
```

**Impact:**
- Storage now receives hybrid config from GraphRAGConfig
- Config hierarchy properly respected: GraphRAGConfig → StorageConfig → env
- Consistent hybrid behavior across processes

## Verification

### Test Demonstration
```python
# Entity ID consistency test
entity_name = "PRESIDENTIAL 1776 AWARD"
correct_id = compute_mdhash_id(entity_name, prefix="ent-")
# Result: ent-617c2f922232a018812b815a85de4888

wrong_id = node_id  # Raw node_id
# Result: PRESIDENTIAL 1776 AWARD

# These are completely different!
```

### Test Results
```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/test_entity_embedding_preservation.py -k "not integration"
======================= 4 passed, 1 deselected in 0.32s ========================
```

All tests pass including:
- `test_entity_id_consistency`: Verifies correct ID derivation
- `test_fallback_to_upsert_when_no_update_payload`: Confirms fallback uses correct IDs

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **compound failure**:

1. **Initial insertion** (`_extraction.py:430`):
   - Correctly uses `compute_mdhash_id(entity_name, prefix="ent-")`
   - Creates entities with sparse+dense embeddings

2. **Post-community fallback** (when hybrid disabled/not detected):
   - **Bug**: Used raw `node_id` as key
   - Created NEW entities instead of updating existing
   - No sparse embeddings (hybrid disabled)

3. **Config propagation failure**:
   - Storage couldn't see GraphRAGConfig hybrid settings
   - Forced fallback path even when hybrid should be enabled

Result: Duplicate entities in Qdrant:
- `ent-xxxxx`: Original with sparse+dense
- `PRESIDENTIAL 1776 AWARD`: Duplicate with dense only

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
1. `nano_graphrag/graphrag.py`:
   - Lines 516, 533-534: Fixed entity ID generation in fallback path
   - Added `compute_mdhash_id` import and proper ID computation

2. `nano_graphrag/config.py`:
   - Line 500: Added `hybrid_search` to `to_legacy_dict()`

3. `tests/test_entity_embedding_preservation.py`:
   - Lines 187-204: Updated test to verify correct ID generation

### Lines Changed
- Total: ~10 lines modified
- Critical fixes only, no extraneous changes

## Why Round 1-2 Didn't Catch This

Our Round 1-2 implementation only fixed the **hybrid-enabled path**:
- ✅ Added payload-only updates for hybrid path
- ✅ Fixed ID generation in hybrid path
- ❌ **Missed the fallback path** (lines 514-548)
- ❌ Didn't notice config propagation issue

The expert review correctly identified we had only partially addressed the problem.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test all code paths**: Both hybrid and fallback paths needed fixes
2. **Config propagation is critical**: Storage must see config, not just env
3. **ID consistency is paramount**: Same ID generation everywhere
4. **Expert review invaluable**: Caught issues we missed

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ Fallback path uses `compute_mdhash_id(entity_name, prefix='ent-')`
- ✅ Config properly propagated via `to_legacy_dict()`
- ✅ Tests verify correct ID generation
- ✅ No duplicate entities created
- ✅ Backward compatible

## Conclusion

Round 3 successfully addresses the critical bugs causing duplicate entities and missing sparse embeddings. The fixes ensure:
1. Consistent entity IDs across all code paths
2. Proper config propagation from GraphRAGConfig to storage
3. No more entities without `ent-` prefix
4. Sparse embeddings preserved when hybrid enabled

These minimal, targeted fixes resolve the root cause without introducing complexity.
